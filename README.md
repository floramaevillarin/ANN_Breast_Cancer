## Overview

This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict breast cancer outcomes. We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to determine if a tumor is malignant or benign based on its features.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset and preprocessing scripts.
- **`models/`**: Includes the ANN model and related files.
- **`src/`**: Has scripts for training, evaluating, and using the model.
- **`venv/`**: Directory for virtual environment (not tracked by Git).
- **`README.md`**: This file with project details.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
